//! Host-side observation of network policy denials.
//!
//! Policy denials are decided deep inside the network stack and, before
//! this module, were visible only as `tracing` records — and only on some
//! paths. Embedding code that wants to react to a denial (surface it in a
//! UI, offer a one-click allowlist entry, audit it) had no programmatic
//! way to see one.
//!
//! A [`PolicyObserver`] is installed on the shared network state and is
//! invoked from the evaluation choke points themselves rather than from
//! individual call sites, so a new caller of the policy API cannot forget
//! to report its denials.
//!
//! Observers run inline on the evaluation path. An implementation should
//! hand the denial to a channel or counter and return; blocking here
//! blocks guest traffic. A [`PolicyDenial`] carries no timestamp: stamping
//! it is the observer's business, and the two shipped consumers of it — a
//! `tracing` subscriber and an embedder's own channel — both have a better
//! clock reading of their own than the evaluation path would take.

///
/// This is the observer a host process gets without asking: embedders that

/// — a supervising daemon reading the runtime's logs — has no other way to
/// see a denial. The event is emitted at `WARN` on the
/// [`DENIAL_LOG_TARGET`] target, carrying one field per denial component so
/// that a `tracing` JSON layer renders it as a machine-readable object and
/// the default text layer renders it as `key=value` pairs.
///
/// The field set is a contract for those consumers: `event`, `direction`,
/// `protocol`, `peer_kind`, `peer`, `port`, `hostname`, `verdict`,
/// `denials`. Fields are always present; unknown values are logged as the
/// empty string rather than omitted, so a parser never has to handle a
/// missing key. The peer is deliberately not called `target`: a JSON layer
/// configured with `flatten_event` puts the `tracing` metadata target at
/// that key, and one of the two would silently win.
///
/// `WARN` is chosen so the line survives the sandbox subprocess's default
/// filter, which is `INFO` — that subprocess is where the network stack
/// runs and its stderr is captured into `runtime.log`, so a denial reaches
/// the file a host consumer reads without anyone passing a verbosity flag.
///
/// # Rate limiting, and how to count
///
/// Denials are decided per *packet*: a deny-by-default sandbox with a chatty
/// guest denies every datagram, every echo and every SYN retransmit, and
/// `runtime.log` rotates at 10 MiB with the lifecycle and VMM diagnostics
/// other tooling reads. So the first denial of a destination is logged at
/// once and further denials of that destination inside [`SUPPRESSION_WINDOW`]
/// are counted rather than logged.
///
/// **`denials` is how many denied packets the line accounts for.** A
/// consumer counting packets sums that field across lines; it never adds
/// anything to it, and it never counts lines. This matters because not every
/// line stands for a packet of its own — a [`DENIAL_FLUSH_EVENT`] line
/// reports a tally for a destination that has since gone quiet, and carries
/// no packet beyond the ones it counts.
///
/// Three `event` values are emitted, and a consumer that only understands
/// the first still counts correctly, just later and coarser:
///
/// * [`DENIAL_LOG_EVENT`] — a denied packet, plus any swallowed before it.
/// * [`DENIAL_FLUSH_EVENT`] — the trailing tally of a destination that
///   stopped being denied. It carries the same destination evidence as the
///   line that opened its suppression window.
/// * [`DENIAL_SATURATED_EVENT`] — the limiter was tracking
///   [`MAX_TRACKED_PEERS`] destinations at once and dropped denials for
///   destinations it had no room to track. Its `peer` is empty, because it
///   stands for many. Without it, a port scan against a deny-all policy
///   would be indistinguishable from silence.
///
/// The rate limiter also collapses the duplicate line a packet would
/// otherwise produce where a platform policy and a tenant policy both deny
/// it.
///
/// Sweeps are what ship trailing tallies, and they run from `on_denied`
/// itself — at most once per [`SUPPRESSION_WINDOW`], so the flood path stays
/// a hash lookup rather than a scan of the map. A tally therefore ships on
/// the next denial *anywhere*, not on the next denial of its own
/// destination. If the guest stops being denied entirely, nothing swept the
/// last tally out — so [`PolicyObserver::flush`] ships it, called by the
/// runtime from the synchronous exit hook it runs before `_exit`. That hook,
/// not [`Drop`], is the shipped teardown path: the sandbox process exits via
/// `_exit`, which runs no destructors at all.
