//! PID 1 handoff to a guest init.
//!
//! After [`init::init`] returns, agentd may be configured to hand off
//! PID 1 to a user-supplied init binary (typically `systemd`, but any
//! init works). This module implements the fork+exec dance:
//!
//! - **Parent** keeps PID 1 (execve preserves it), execs the target
//!   init, and is supervised by the kernel as the new PID 1.
//! - **Child** continues as a normal grandchild process and runs the
//!   agent loop, serving host requests over virtio-serial.
//!
//! The handoff happens before any tokio runtime is built and before
//! virtio-serial is opened, keeping the fork single-threaded and
//! free of duplicated runtime state.
//!
//! [`init::init`]: crate::init::init
//!
//! ### Performance constraint
//!
//! The fork point relies on agentd's RSS being tiny (<5MB) so
//! copy-on-write page-table duplication is cheap (~1µs/page). If
//! agentd ever grows large in-memory caches before this point, fork
//! cost scales linearly with mapped memory. Keep init::init light and
//! don't move the fork point later.
